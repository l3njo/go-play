# go-play

Go-play is a simple go library that lets you work with random data generated by games of chance, such as cards, dice, coin tosses, etc.

Go-play was built as a sort of "hello world", an introduction to the Go programming language. Ergo, I don't see how it could possibly help anyone. Nonetheless, if you think you can use or improve go-play, do feel free to do so.

## go-play packages
